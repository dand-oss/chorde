# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased
### Changed
- Made ttl_skip not return default/CacheMissError when the
  only available value is below the skip threshold. Instead,
  return the available item as does TieredInclusiveCache.
  The logic works better with lazy decorators and async
  refresh in this way, and is more uniform across clients.

### Added
- Support for getMulti and getTtlMulti to all clients,
  with optimized versions for memcached
- An option tcp_nodelay to MemcachedStoreClient to reduce
  latency in latency-sensitive applications

## [0.1.0]

Initial release
